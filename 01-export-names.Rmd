This uses the built-in R [babynames](https://github.com/hadley/babynames) package to get all names and then exports them. It has an advantage over the Social Security version in that it has the `prop` field, or the proportion of children born with that name in each year.

Downside is it is only update through 2017 as of this writing.


```{r setup, echo=T, results='hide', message=F, warning=F}
library(fs)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(babynames)
```

```{r getnames}
names <- babynames %>% 
  arrange(year %>% desc()) %>% 
  rename(
    count = n
  )

names %>% 
  head()
```

```{r export}
names %>% write_csv("data-out/names-all.csv")

# write since 1980
names %>% 
  filter(year > 1979) %>% 
  write_csv("data-out/names-since80.csv")
```
